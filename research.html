	    My main research interests are numerical linear algebra
	    and high performance computing. My PhD thesis at Inria
	    Bordeaux - Sud-Ouest (France) focused on low-rank
	    compression for sparse direct solvers, with a study of
	    dedicated graph ordering and partitining strategies. I am
	    currently studying multi-precision algorithms at
	    Universidad Jaume I (Spain), and I have been working on
	    eigenproblems during an internship at Innovative Computing
	    Laboratory (United States) and a visit at King Abdullah
	    University of Science and Technology (Saudi
	    Arabia). </br> </br>

	  <div class="row"><h1>Sparse direct solvers and low-rank compression</h1>
	  </div>
	  In the context of my PhD thesis, I have integrated Block
	  Low-Rank compression in the PaStiX solver, which solves
	  sparse linear systems. The objective was to reduce both the
	  time and the memory complexities by computing an approximate
	  solution at a given accuracy. We have introduced low-rank
	  compression and new dedicated kernels that perform low-rank
	  addition for sparse structures, while maintaning the same
	  level of parallism than the original version of the PaStiX
	  solver, to take advantage of all features that were
	  developed in previous works.
	  <div class="row"><h1>Graph ordering and partitioning</h1>
	  </div>
	  Low-rank compression integrated in sparse direct solvers may
	  be impacted by the granularity of the block-data structure:
	  blocks are generally small for sparse matrices. In order to
	  reduce this burden, we have proposed a reordering strategy
	  to reduce the number of off-diagonal blocks in the symbolic
	  factorization. In addition, we have studied clustering
	  strategies for Block Low-Rank, which consist of special
	  partitioning of separators that appear during the nested
	  dissection.
	  <div class="row"><h1>Multi-precision algorithms</h1>
	  </div>
	  In the context of my Post-Doctorat, I am investigating the
	  use of multi-precision for linear algebra. The objective is
	  to compute some parts of an algorithm in a reduced
	  precision, to minimize data movements and energy
	  consumption. One of the main challenges is to control
	  numerical properties of algorithms to maintain sufficient
	  accuracy.
	  <div class="row"><h1>Singular value decomposition and eigenvalue problems</h1>
	  </div>
	  I have been working on eigenproblems during an internship at
	    Innovative Computing Laboratory (United States) and a
	    visit at King Abdullah University of Science and
	    Technology (Saudi Arabia). We have developed a task-based
	    version of the Divide & Conquer algorithm to compute
	    eigenpairs of symmetric tridiagonal matrices, as well as a
	    task-based version of reduction to band. One open problem
	    which I am interested on is to implement a full data-flow
	    eigensolver for heterogeneous architectures.
